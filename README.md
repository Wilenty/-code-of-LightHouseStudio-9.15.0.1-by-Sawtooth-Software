`Nobody here knows what command line options exist in the original installer (if the options you need even exist). Get back to the creator and explain this to them.`

You don't know, but not: "Nobody here knows..."

Some time ago there was one person who willing to help the "askers" on the Inno-Forum, but you (and some other "smarter" users) and the Moderator of the Inno-Forum didn't respect me at all: https://groups.google.com/g/innosetup/c/lPrRbpfxSJQ

So, now (really) on Inno-Forum no one knows if in some installer there are some "custom command-line parameters", because all of You are wiser than all others!
